/**
 * The usage-data setting has to actually stop analytics.
 *
 * It previously lived in renderer `localStorage`, which the main process cannot
 * read, so nothing consulted it: a person who turned it off was told their
 * telemetry stopped and it did not. That is the one failure mode of a consent
 * control that matters, and it is invisible — the switch moves, the label
 * changes, and events keep shipping.
 *
 * These assert the two properties that make the fix real: every path that can
 * send is gated, and the gate is closed until consent has been read.
